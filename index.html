      <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
      <li> Unsalted butter</li>
      <li>White granulated sugar </li>
      <li>Pure vanilla extract or vanilla bean paste </li>
      <li>Salt</li>

    </center>
    <ol>
      <li> Sift together the all-purpose flour, salt, and baking powder in a medium bowl.</li>
      <li>In a large mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add the eggs, one at a time, while mixing. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Beat in the vanilla.</li>
    <li>With the mixer running, gradually add in the flour mixture with a measuring cup or large spoon and mix until everything is well incorporated.</li>
      <li>Divide the dough in half, shape it into two disks, and tightly wrap it in plastic. Refrigerate for 2 hours or up to 2 days. If chilling longer than 2 hours, let the dough sit at room temperature for 15 to 30 minutes or until slightly softened before rolling out.</li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Roll the dough on a lightly floured surface to ¼-inch-thickness.</li>
      <li>Cut out shapes using 2½-inch cookie cutters. Re-roll as needed for more cookies. Place the cut-outs on a non-stick baking sheet or parchment paper or silicone mat-lined cookie sheet 1 inch apart. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until the bottom edges start to turn brown. Let cool for a few minutes on the pan then transfer to a wire rack and cool completely. Serve plain or decorate with royal icing.</li>

      <tr>
      <td>1. Cool Cookies before Decorating</td>
      <td>1. Roll Out the Dough Too Thin or Too Thick: If you roll this dough out even a little too thin, they'll become fragile. But if you roll the dough out too thick, then they won't cook through and become dense.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>2. Personalize with any cookie cutter.</td>
        <td>2. Don't Overbake: Don't overbake the cookies. They should be removed from the oven just before they turn golden brown at the edges. They will continue cooking on the hot baking sheet after you take them out.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>3. Use Room Temperature Ingredients: This helps with even mixing and better texture</td>
        <td>3. Don't Overload with Icing: Don't use too much royal icing or other decorations, as it can overwhelm the taste and texture of the cookie.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>4. Space Cookies Appropriately: Do leave enough space between cookies on the baking sheet to allow for spreading. Usually, about 2 inches apart is a good rule of thumb.</td>
        <td>4. Don't Use Warm Cookie Sheets: Don't place cookie dough on warm or hot baking sheets. This can cause premature spreading.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>5. Use Parchment Paper: Line your baking sheets with parchment paper to prevent sticking and make clean-up easier.</td>
        <td>5. Don't Skip Chilling: Don't skip chilling the dough. Chilled dough results in cookies that maintain their shape and have a better texture.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>6. Measure Ingredients Accurately: Do measure your ingredients precisely, especially when it comes to flour. Too much flour can result in dry, crumbly cookies.</td>
        <td>6. Don't Store Warm Cookies: Don't store cookies in an airtight container while they are still warm, as condensation can make them soggy. Allow them to cool completely before storing.
